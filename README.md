# MVC_CatClicker-Javascript

It is a simple app by implementing mvc pattern in Javascript for my learning purpose.
This application involves
 1.catClickerBasic
 2.MVC_CatClicker
 3.MVC_CatClickerPro
 All the applications does the same functionality, Yet the Pro version has Admin feature which let you to create a new cat image.
 Cat images are also provided, so you can use any of the cat images.
-----
 catClickerBasic

 It is a simple cat clicker, which display's two cats and calculate the number of click counts.
 It is the basic first version which does not follow any design patterns
-------
  MVC_CatClicker
 
 It is sturctured as MVC pattern, which the view part is seperated as two, and the model part holds the data required
 contorller is used to connect the model and the view.
 I won't say it is complete MVC catclicker since some improvements need to be made.
---------
 # MVC_CatClickerPro
  
 I developed the Pro version for the MVC_CatClicker,which involves responding dynamic changes in the view.
 I has a Admin mode where, we can add new cats.
 Here,
 Model part is used to hold the data and insert the new data
 View part will divide the view, and render corresponding template into it
 Contoller is used to serve the informations needed for both model and view
