# MVC_CatClicker-Javascript
It is a simple app by implementing mvc pattern in Javascript for my learning purpose.
I build this app when I was learning free course titled as "Javascript Design Patterns" at Udacity

Applications :
 1.MVC_CatClicker
 2.MVC_CatClickerPro

 Both the applications do the same functionality, Yet the Pro version has Admin feature which let you to create a new cat image.
 Cat images are also provided, so you can use any of the cat images.
